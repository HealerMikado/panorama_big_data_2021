    "\n",
    "If DataFrames are immutable, they can however be **_transformed_** in other DataFrames, in the sense that a modified copy is returned. Such **transformations** include: filtering, sampling, dropping columns, selecting columns, adding new columns...\n",
    "\n",
    "First, you can get information about the columns with:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "df.columns       # get the column names\n",
    "df.schema        # get the column names and their respective type\n",
    "df.printSchema() # same, but human-readable\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can select columns with the `select()` method. It takes as argument a list of column name. For example :\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "df_with_less_columns = df\\\n",
    "  .select(\"variable3\",\"variable_four\",\"variable-6\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Yes, you do need the ugly \\ at the end of the line,\n",
    "# if you want to chain methods between lines in Python\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can get nested columns easily with :\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "df.select(\"parentField.nestedField\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To filter data you could use the `filter()` method. It take as input an expression that gets evaluated for each observation and should return a boolean. Sampling is performed with the `sample()` method. For example :\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "df_with_less_rows = df\\\n",
    "  .sample(fraction=0.001)\\\n",
    "  .filter(df.variable1==\"value\")\\\n",
    "  .show(10)\n",

They are called *narrow transformation* For example, to sample a DataFrame, Spark sample every partitions in parallel because sample all partition produce the sample DataFrame. For some transformations, like `groupBy()` it's impossible, and it's cannot be run in parallel.\n",

    "\n",
    "This is because Spark has what is known as **lazy evaluation**, in the sense that it will wait as much as it can before performing the actual computation. Said otherwise, when you run an instruction such as:\n",

    "tweet_author_hashtags = df_tweet_big.select(\"auteur\",\"hashtags\")\n",

    "Spark is quite extreme in its laziness, since only a handful of methods called **actions**, by opposition to **transformations**, will trigger an execution. The most notable are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `collect()`, explicitly asking Spark to fetch the resulting rows instead of to lazily wait for more instructions,\n",
    "2. `take(n)`, asking for `n` first rows\n",
    "3. `first()`, an alias for `take(1)`\n",
    "4. `show()` and `show(n)`, human-friendly alternatives[^5]\n",
    "5. `count()`, asking for the numbers of rows\n",
    "6. all the \"write\" methods (write on file, write to database), see [here](https://spark.apache.org/docs/3.1.1/api/python/reference/pyspark.sql.html#input-and-output) for the list\n",
    "\n",
    "[^5]: `first()` is exactly `take(1)` ([ref]( https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37495039/difference-between-spark-rdds-take1-and-first)) and show prints the result instead of returning it as a list of rows ([ref](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53884994/what-is-the-difference-between-dataframe-show-and-dataframe-take-in-spark-t))\n",
    "\n",
    "**This has advantages:** on huge data, you don't want to accidently perform a computation that is not needed. Also, Spark can optimize each **stage** of the execution in regard to what comes next. For instance, filters will be executed as early as possible, since it diminishes the number of rows on which to perform later operations. On the contrary, joins are very computation-intense and will be executed as late as possible. The resulting **execution plan** consists in a **directed acyclic graph** (DAG) that contains the tree of all required actions for a specific computation, ordered in the most effective fashion.\n",
    "\n",
    "**This has also drawbacks.** Since the computation is optimized for the end result, the intermediate stages are discarded by default. So if you need a DataFrame multiple times, you have to cache it in memory because if you don't Spark will recompute it every single time. \n",
