**Mainframe era** (1940 - mid 1970)
  - It's not a super-computer
  - Commercial, scientific, and large-scale computing only
  - Only big enterprise can buy mainframes
  - No direct user interaction (no screen nor keyboard), but card punches
  - Throughtput optimize (I/O operation)
  - Use case: credit card operation, flight reservation, share market

**Fat client era** (Mid 1970 - mid-1990)
  - Development of micro-computing, personal computers become cheaper and cheaper
  - Instead of one mainframe for data and computing, one server is for the data, and computation are executed on personal computer (**fat client**)
  - Fat clients are independent of each other (server here only in order to download the data)

**Grid Computing** (mid-1990 - 2010)

  - Scientists can't afford in-house datacenters
  -  Use idle machines and make them work together on bigger tasks (**CPU scavenging**)
  - Parallel computing ideas, originally developed for a single computer, can be applied _between_ computers
  - Many still in use today ([SETI@home](https://setiathome.ssl.berkeley.edu/))

  - In November 2019 the best grid's 495 820 computers was computing on average at the rate 30 petaflops (BOINC, Berkeley, [link](https://boinc.berkeley.edu)), same as the 5th fastest supercomputer
  - for comparison the fastest super computer today (Summit, IBM, [link](https://www.olcf.ornl.gov/olcf-resources/compute-systems/summit)) delivers ~200 petaflops

## Traditional IT

üí° **1 physical machine** = **1 function**

  - SMTP (mail) server
  - DNS
  - Web server, FTP server
  - proxy
  - ...

--

- .green[Pros : security, no middleware]
- .red[Cons : cost, overdimensioned hardware]

---
## Virtualization

üí° **1 physical machine** = **multiple virtual machines** (**VMs**).

--
- VMs are isolated from each other

--
- Can have their own OS

--
- Don't know there are other VMs on the same machine

--
- Have there own resources


---
## Virtualization

.green[Pros :]
- Mutualization of cost (less machines)
- Better CPU utilization
- Independant OS
- Easy migration and deployment
- Can run old OS

--

.red[Cons :] 
- Is the physical machine goes down all VMs go down too
- There are some security issues

???
It's not something new. Existe since 1960, but still relevant ! 

---

## Containerization

Operating Systems generally do much more than what you need for a specific application.

üí° Use **only the libraries required** for your specific app

- Needs a runtime engine (like [Docker](https://www.docker.com/))
- Pros : lightweight, easy to use, little prior knowledge required
- Cons : security issues, can become very complex

---
## Cloud computing definition

Wikipedia : 
&gt;Cloud computing  is Internet-based  computing,  whereby shared resources, software, and informationare provided to computers and  other devices on demand, **like the electricity grid**. Cloud computing  is a style of computing  in which dynamically  scalable and  often virtualized  resources are provided  as a service over the Internet.

--

In a nutshell :

- **Shared** physical ressources (mutalization of cost)
- In **remote** location (access via the Internet)
- **On-demand**, **scalable** services

The contrary to cloud-computing is **on-premise** or **self-hosted** computing.

---
## Why cloud computing ?

- The world is changing faster than ever

--
- Need quick responses to new problems

--
- Building a new datacenter, buying new servers or creating new architectures takes too much time ! 

--
- On-demand means it is possible to create new projects in a coffee-break time

---
## Why cloud computing ? 

- üí∞ Less investment : don't have to buy anything, just pay for what you use

--

- üìà Easily scalable : "just" pay for more resources

--

- ü§∏Ô∏è Flexible : create and delete resources in no time

--
- Ô∏èüîß No extra maintenance and operation costs : it's the responsibility of your cloud provider

--

- üß± Reliable : it's the responsibility of your cloud provider

--

- üî¨ Up-to-date : new services are propose regularly, and you pay for what you use

---

## Different categories of cloud services

‚ö†Ô∏è *The following distinction is not exact science! Some services may fall in-between categories.*

- **IaaS** (**Infrastructure as a Service**) : you rent a bare virtual machine. You must build everything from basic components: processing, memory, storage, network. The cheapest and most flexible service, but requires a fair amount of knowledge.

- **PaaS** (**Platform as a Service**) : you rent an already build platform like a database, a cluster, a scheduler, etc. Everything comes pre-installed: network configuration, OS, libraries, etc. You often can tune settings. Little knowledge is required.

- **SaaS** (**Software as a Service**) : you use a pre-configured application, like a Slack or Discord instance, a database interface or a statistical software such as R Studio. You don't control at all how things are implemented. No knowledge required.

---
## Some cloud providers

- Amazon web service
- Google cloud platform
- Microsoft azure
- OVH Cloud (French)

.footnote[There are many others: Alibaba, IBM, etc. Smaller companies are specialised in IaaT, such as [Vultr](https://www.vultr.com) or [Linode](https://www.linode.com) while some other are specialised into Paas such as [Heroku]() or [DataBricks](https://databricks.com/fr/). Some go for both, such as [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/). Later arrivers usually have cleaner interfaces.]

---
## Principles of IaaS

When it comes to infrastructure as a service, all cloud-providers basically share the same two basic products:

1. normal storage
2. virtual machines

---
## Normal storage

**Normal storage** is the place where you put all of your files, script, logs, data or else: **anything that is worth saving.**

"Normal", in "normal storage" means:
- slower access than directly from the virtual machine
- faster than recovery storage

Normal storage is organised into units often called "buckets".

???

(Of course you may want to use database services instead, but let's forget about that for now.)

---
## Normal storage

- The provider takes charge of the **integrity** and **availability** of your files (through **replication**)

- Each resource you store gets **a unique URI** (‚âà URL), that you can refer to from inside or outside the cloud-provider ecosystem

- Data is usually **encrypted server-side** : stealing physically disks from a Google server is useless but by default, the provider stores the encryption key themselves somewhere, and the communication between you and the ecosystem is not encrypted

---
## Normal storage

Storage solutions have different names, but similar pricing schemes:

| Provider | Service's  name |      Store |                Write |     Read |
|----------|-----------------|------------|----------------------|-----------|
| Google   | Cloud Storage   | 0,03 $/Go |                 free |      free |
| Amazon   | S3              | 0,02 $/Go |                 free |   0,09 $/Go |
| Azure    | Blob Storage    | 0,02 $/Go | 0,00 $ / 10 000 op. | 0.02 $ / 10 000 op. |
| OVH      | Object Storage  | 0,01  ‚Ç¨/Go |                 free |    0,01 ‚Ç¨/Go |

Prices are given monthly.

---
## Normal storage

Other forms of storage, beyond "normal" storage, include:

- disks that can be "attached" to and "detached" from a virtual machine (faster, but more expensive)
- storage whose physical location adapts to usage
- so-called "cold" storage for unfrequently-accessed storage (less expensive, but you pay reads and writes more)
- archive solution (inexpensive, but takes min. to hours for access)

## Normal storage, the snowmobile

---
## Virtual machines

The other component of a typical IaaS environement are **virtual machines** (VMs).

A VM is made of a combination of components:
- memory
- processing units
- local storage (hard disk)
- an operating system (FR: syst√®me d'exploitation), typically Linux

VMs come in a fixed (but high) number of pre-configured options. Some providers offer tailored configuration, but they are usually more expensive that the closest pre-configured option.

???

Imagine that on cluster C, on rack R, on server S, there is in total 124 CPUs, 14 GPUs, 200Go of memory and 10 To of storage. If the configuration you request for your virutal machine V fits on S, then V will get access to the physical resources there. If V does not fit on V, the orchestrator of the cluster will try to fit in on machine S' in the same rack. Then on an other rack. If it can't find a room, it will maybe try to fit a part of the configuration (say memory and processing units) on S and the rest (local storage) on S'.

---
## Virtual machines

Virtual machines (VMs) come with little pre-configured software, and _you_ are the one to perform all the rest of the configuration. You may use such machines to :

- rent a over powerful machine with some GPU to train one machine-learning model
- try something which need a linux machine or an exotic configuration 

---
## Virtual machines

‚ö†Ô∏è Holding the physical resource and doing nothing with it comes at a cost for the provider,so **you will pay for a reserved VM even when you do not use it.** 

---
## Virtual machines

**SHUT DOWN**

**YOUR VMs**

## Virtual machines

![](img/meme/brain.jpg)

---
## Platform as a service (PaaS)

An already package platforme. Just need some tuning.

As a statician, services you may come to use are:

- databases
- data analytics
- machine-learning
- serverless computing

.green[Pros]: scale automatically, less maintenance, easy to access

.red[Cons]: less configurable, possibly more expensive, cloud provider dependent

**Exemples :** Hadoop Platform (AWS EMR, GCP Cloud Dataproc, Azure HDInsight)

---
## Software as a Service, SaaS


- Provide the capability to use an application, managed by the provider (application provider)
- The consumer do not control anything, except some user-specific settings
- You must agree some terms and conditions before use
- Usually not appropriate for sensitive data (especially if the service is "free")

**Exemples :** Gmail, Github, Binder... (most the services you use as an individual)

---
## Some exemples of cloud computing success

### The New York Times

.pull-left[**The need**

- conversion from TIFF to pdf of all articles from 1851 to 1922
- 4TB of input (405,000 very large TIFF images, 3.3 million articles in SGML and 405,000 xml files mapping articles to rectangular regions in the TIFF‚Äôs)]

--

.pull-right[**The realization**

- Run around 100 EC2 instances to create an Hadoop cluster for 24h (estimate cost 800$)
- Realized they made a mistake
- Rerun the cluster with the fix for 24h (estimate cost 800$)]

--

**Summary**

- Convert to pdf 70 years of newspapers for less than 2000$ in approx. 1 day!

---
## Some exemples of cloud computing success

### Animoto

Animoto is a cloud-based video creation service (Saas)

- Does not possess any physical server
- Rents servers (IaaS) to deploy its application
- Started with 40 servers
- Scaled from 40 up to 5000 servers in 4 days to meet the growing number of subscriber !

## Cloud and ecology

- It's not because you don't own the server that the server does not pollute.
- The internet causes about 4% of the worldwide emissions of GHG
- Datacenters are responsible for 25% of emissions
- Mutualisation of resources thanks to cloud computing could be greener than on-premise computing
- But, cheaper resources also means increased usage (**rebound effect**)

## To sum up

- Cloud computing = multiple services :
  - IaaS : only basic ressources provided. Good for experimented people
  - PaaS : a packaged plateform. Good if you need a database, a Hadoop cluster etc
  - Saas : a ready to use service.

--
- Hardware is accessible through VMs or containers, not directly, and is shared with other users

--
- Beware even if your machines are idle you are still billed

--
- IaaS and PaaS need some basic knowledge (ssh connection, basic shell commands)

--
- Cloud computing can be a solution, but not always
