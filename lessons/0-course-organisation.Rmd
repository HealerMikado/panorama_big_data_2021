## Motivation

--

Machine-learning algorithms do not scale well.

--
- exact solutions do not scale // ex: matrix inversion is of $O(n^3)$ complexity

--
- approximate solutions do not scale either

???

Some very popular machine-learning algorithms do not scale well.

Exact solutions do not scale: matrix inversion (for instance) is a problem with an algorithmic complexity of $O(n^3)$ ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_complexity_of_mathematical_operations)).

Approximate solutions do not scale either: Lately, Google's pre-computation of BERT (a neural network for natural language processing) thanks to gradient-descent took 4 days on a mesmerizing 64-TPU cluster.

## Motivation

Machine-learning algorithms do not scale well.

- exact solutions do not scale // ex: matrix inversion is of $O(n^3)$ complexity
- approximate solutions do not scale either

--

One would thus consider how these computation procedures may be accellerated.

--
- Using algorithmic tricks?

--
- Using more memory?

--
- Parallelizing on several computers?

--
- Relaxing our precision requirements? ...


--

These are many many solutions... and each of this problems is far from trivial!

--

Computing a median can prove challenging to speed up!

---

## Goal

At the end of this course, you will:

--
- understand the potential bottlenecks of data-intensive processes

--
- choose between concurrent solutions for dealing with such bottlenecks

--
- understand the map-reduce principle and have practical experience with Spark on HDFS

--
- have an overview of the cloud computing ecosystem and practical experience with one provider (AWS)

--
- get a glimpse over the *physical*, *ethical*, *economical*, *financial*, *environmental*, *statistical*, *political*... challenges, limitations and dangers of the suggested solutions

???

In this course, we will review the bases of computer science that may be required for accelerating statistical estimation processes.

Ex techniques: sampled vs. exhaustive, sequential vs. parallel, in memory vs. on disk, whole data vs. in chunks, local vs. cloud...

???

There will be 6h course + 1h30 presentation of cloud computing solutions:

There will be 9h tutorials + 1h30 hands-on session with AWS:

The course's content this year is the same as 2nd-year students' "Introduction to Big Data". 1 out of the 3 tutorials (How to accelerate a neural network?) is specific to this course.

<!-- TP2: How to speed up the computation of a statistical summary? -->

## Evaluation

- 1 lab report (the last one)
- 1 desk examination (most probably multiple-choice questionnaire)

---

## Material

Course and tutorial material will be available on Moodle.
