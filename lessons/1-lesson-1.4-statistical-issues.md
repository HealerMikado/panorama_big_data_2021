## Statistical issues

???

- statistical power
- false discovery rate & multiple tests
- low information density
- data improper for causal relationships

Big data uses mathematical analysis, optimization, inductive statistics and concepts from nonlinear system identification[24] to infer laws (regressions, nonlinear relationships, and causal effects) from large sets of data with low information density[25] to reveal relationships and dependencies, or to perform predictions of outcomes and behaviors
