## Hadoop MapReduce in a nutshell

- A widely use computing engine
- Based on the MapReduce programming model 
- Part part the Hadoop ecosystem
- Can process *very large file* 
- Throughput optimized

## Key Concepts

### Architecture

 Main/workers architecture

- **JobTracker** (main): accepts MR jobs submitted by clients. Assigns Map and Reduce Tasks to workers, re-execute failed/slow tasks
- **TaskTrackers** (worker): workhorse of the system. Run tasks, manage storage, send/receive data

--

Usually TaskTrackers are host by the same machine as HDFS DataNode, but it's not an obligation.

---

## Key Concepts

### Two phases process

- **Map** : reads each record and process it. Extract valuable data from each record.
- **Reduce** : aggregates, summarizes, transforms data with the same output map key

--

Map/Reduce is an old programming paradigm. You can do it in python if you want.

---

## Key Concepts

### The Map phase : Input

Records from the data source (line of a file, row of a DB, documents) as **key:value** pairs. Examples :
  - filename : line
  - row index : row
  - document name : document

Each **TaskTrackers** has a different input.
  
---
## Key Concepts

### The Map phase : Behaviour

Each **TaskTrackers** executes the same code for each input. Example :
  - split a text into word
  - filter record
  
--
You can keep track of the past if you want (like the previous record)

---
## Key Concepts

### The Map phase : Output

Each **TaskTrackers** produces a list of **map_key:map_value** pairs. Examples :
  - a list of word:word_count
  - a list of year:max
  - etc
  
  
---
## Key Concepts

### The Map phase exemple : max temperature from each year

- **Input**: positional file of the National Climatic Data Center
  - Position 15-18 : year
  - Position 87- 92 : temperature



-**Map function** : Extract the temperature of a line if temperature !=9999

-**Output** : List of year:temperature

## Key Concepts

### The Reduce phase : Input

All the output value of the map tasks with the same key are send to same reduce task.

--

The input of a reduce fonction is a `list(map_key:list(map_value))` 


--
For instance a list of word and how many time they appear in each line.


.pull-left[
Reduce task 1
```python
{
  jasmine:[1],
  dragon: [1],
  cabage: [3,4,1,2]
}
```
]

.pull-right[
Reduce task 2
```python
{
  the:[1,3,5,3],
  hadoop: [1,1,1],
  rose: [2,3,4,5,6]
}
```
]

---
## Key Concepts

### The Reduce phase : Behaviour

Each **TaskTrackers** executes the same code for each input. Usally it's an aggregation by key
  - sum
  - average
  - max/min
  
  
--
This operation cannot depend of the other received key because you cannot
controle the *shuffle*.

---
## Key Concepts

### The Reduce phase : Output

Each **TaskTrackers** produces a list of **map_key:reduce_value** pairs. Examples :
  - How many time each word are used word:sum_count
  - The max temperature for each year year:max_temp
  - etc
