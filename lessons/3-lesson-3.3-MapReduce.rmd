## Hadoop MapReduce in a nutshell

- A widely use file processing framework
- Based on the `map()` and `reduce()` programming model 
- Part of the Hadoop ecosystem
- Can process *very large file* 
- Throughput optimized
- Highly parallel

???

- Open source
- Run the best on HDFS
- batch processing oriented

## Key Concepts

### Architecture

It's a main/worker architecture.

- **Resource Manager** (main) : schedule, orchestrate tasks ;
- **Node manager** (worker) : run tasks.

---

## Key Concepts

### Two phases process

- **Map** : reads each record and process it. Extract valuable data from each record.
- **Reduce** : aggregates, summarizes, transforms data with the same output map key

--

`map()` and `reduce()` are an old programming paradigm. You can do it in python if you want.

--

**Two phases = two code to write**

---

## Key Concepts

### The Map phase : Input

Records from the data source (line of a file, row of a DB, documents) as is a `{key1:value, key2:value, ...}`. Examples :
  - filename : line
  - reccord index : reccord
  - document name : document

Each **mapper** has a its own input.

???

Usualy the data source is a file in HDFS, so split in bloc, each mapper reads a block

---
## Key Concepts

### The Map phase : Behaviour

Each **mapper** executes the same code for each reccord Example :
  - split a line into word
  - filter records
  - extract values
  - scalar operations
  
---
## Key Concepts

### The Map phase : Output

Each **mapper** produces `{key_map1:value, key_map2:value, ...}` pairs. Examples :
  - word count : `{to:1, be:1, or:1, not:1, to:1, be:1}`
  - max temperature : `{1990:320, 1900:123, 1901:235}`
  - etc

### How to get the max temp for each year in the USA ?

The map phase

- **Input**: positional file of the National Climatic Data Center
  - Position 15-18 : year
  - Position 87- 92 : temperature

- **Map function** : Extract the temperature of a line if temperature !=9999

- **Output** : List of year:temperature

---
### The Shuffle phase

Because **mapper** and **reducer** are distinct, need to transfer data between then.


--
Output map keys are randomly assigned to **reducer** and all related values are transfered to them.


---

## Key Concepts

### The Reduce phase : Input
The input of a reduce function is

```
{
  map_key1:[value1, value2..],
  map_key2:[value3, value4..],
...}
```


--
For instance a list of word and how many time they appear in each line.


.pull-left[
Reduce task 1
```python
{
  1900 : [320, 123, 234, 120, 165, 246], 
  1903 : [196]
}
```
]

.pull-right[
Reduce task 2
```python
{
  1901 : [245],
  1902 : [001, 301]
}
```
]


???
How the shuffle works it's quite complexe and not very useful
---
## Key Concepts

### The Reduce phase : Behaviour

Each **reducer** executes the same code for each input. Usually it's an aggregation by key
  - sum
  - average
  - max/min


--
This operation cannot depend of the other received key because you cannot
controle the *shuffle*.


---
## Key Concepts

### The Reduce phase : Output

Each **reducer** produces a list of 
```
{
  reduce_key1:value1,
  reduce_key1:value2,
...}
```
pairs. Examples :
  - Word count : `{to:2, be:2, or:1, not:1}`
  - The max temperature for each year `{1900:320, 1901:245, 1902:301, 1903:196 }`
  - etc

--

This input is written into the file system (increase latency)

The reduce phase

- **Input**: output of the map phase, grouped by key

- **Reduce function** : Get the max value for each key

- **Output** : List of year:max temperature

## Key Concepts

### Some properties

- **Data locality** : MapReduce run map phase where the data are located if possible
- **Fault tolerance** : if a job fails, MR just rerun the job
- **Straggler mitigation** : if a task takes to much time, MR launch a *speculative copy*

---

## How to run MapReduce tasks ?

- No nice GUI by default
- Have to run with CLI
- Or install Apache Hue

---

## Pros of MapReduce

- Fault tolerance
- High throughput
- Scale easily

---

## Cons of MapReduce

Write your ouput in the file system
- High latency processing
- Iterative algorithms are very slow (like ML algorithms)

---
## When MapReduce is a good choice ?

- When you have HDFS
- To batch process files

---
## When MapReduce is a bad choice ?

- If you need interactive session (data exploration)
- You want to process other things than text file but don't want to learn java
- To run ML algorithms
- To process streams

---
## Keep in mind

- MapReduce is a file processing framework !
- Throughput oriented
- *Write once read many* philosophy
- Perfect for batch processing
- No GUI, only CLI 
- For statistics, ML, interactive sessions you should use **Spark**
