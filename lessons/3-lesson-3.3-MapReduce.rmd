## Hadoop MapReduce in a nutshell

- A widely use file processing framework
- Based on the MapReduce programming model 
- Part part the Hadoop ecosystem
- Can process *very large file* 
- Throughput optimized
- Highly parallele

???

- Open source
- Run the best on HDFS
- batch processing oriented

## Key Concepts

### Architecture

Build on top of a resource management layer. It's a main/worker architecture.

- **Resource Manager** (main) : schedule, orchestrate tasks ;
- **Node manager** (worker) : run tasks.

---

## Key Concepts

### Two phases process

- **Map** : reads each record and process it. Extract valuable data from each record.
- **Reduce** : aggregates, summarizes, transforms data with the same output map key

--

Map/Reduce is an old programming paradigm. You can do it in python if you want.

--

**Two phases = two code to write**

---

## Key Concepts

### The Map phase : Input

Records from the data source (line of a file, row of a DB, documents) as **key:value** pairs. Examples :
  - filename : line
  - row index : row
  - document name : document

Each **mapper** has a his own input.

???

Usualy the data source is a file in HDFS, so split in bloc, each mapper reads a block

---
## Key Concepts

### The Map phase : Behaviour

Each **mapper** executes the same code for each input. Example :
  - split a text into word
  - filter records
  - extract values
  - scalar operations
  

--
You can keep track of the past if you want (like the previous record)

---
## Key Concepts

### The Map phase : Output

Each **mapper** produces a list of **map_key:map_value** pairs. Examples :
  - a list of word:word_count
  - a list of year:temperature_exracted
  - etc

### How to get the max temp for each year in the USA ?

The map phase

- **Input**: positional file of the National Climatic Data Center
  - Position 15-18 : year
  - Position 87- 92 : temperature

- **Map function** : Extract the temperature of a line if temperature !=9999

- **Output** : List of year:temperature

---

## Key Concepts

### The Reduce phase : Input

All the output value of the map tasks with the same key are send to same reduce task (*shuffle*).

--

The input of a reduce function is a `list(map_key:list(map_value))` 


--
For instance a list of word and how many time they appear in each line.


.pull-left[
Reduce task 1
```python
[
  1900 : [320, 123, 234, 120, 165, 246], 
  1903 : [196]
]
```
]

.pull-right[
Reduce task 2
```python
[
  1901 : [245],
  1902 : [001, 301]
]
```
]


???
How the shuffle works it's quite complexe and not very useful
---
## Key Concepts

### The Reduce phase : Behaviour

Each **reducer** executes the same code for each input. Usually it's an aggregation by key
  - sum
  - average
  - max/min


--
This operation cannot depend of the other received key because you cannot
controle the *shuffle*.


---
## Key Concepts

### The Reduce phase : Output

Each **reducer** produces a list of **map_key:reduce_value** pairs. Examples :
  - How many time each word are used word:sum_count
  - The max temperature for each year year:max_temp
  - etc

--

This input is written into the file system (increase latency)

### How to get the max temp for each year in the USA ?

The reduce phase

- **Input**: output of the map phase, grouped by key

- **Reduce function** : Get the max value for each key

- **Output** : List of year:max temperature

## Key Concepts

### Some properties

- **Data locality** : MapReduce run map phase where the data are located if possible
- **Fault tolerance** : if a job fails, MR just rerun the job
- **Straggler mitigation** : if a task takes to much time, MR launch a *speculative copy*

---

## How to write MapReduce tasks ?

- MR is written in java, complete java API
- No real python/R API

--
One solution **Hadoop Streaming**

---

## Hadoop Streaming

- Not about stream processing
- A workaround to use any language with MapReduce

--

**Hadoop Streaming streams the file in the standard input**

---

## Hadoop Streaming how does it work ?

1. Hadoop read the input file
2. Write each line in the *standard input*
3. Your process must read the line in the standard input and write the result back in
4. Hadoop Streaming read the standard input to get the result

---

## Hadoop Streaming

In python :

```python
import sys

for line in sys.stdin : #Read the standard input
    #process data

    print(data, file = sys.stdout) #Write back in the standar output
```

--
It's only common python without any special library. **Perfect for process text file**.


---

## How to run MapReduce task ?

- No nice GUI by default
- Have to run with CLI
- Or install Apache Hue

---

## Pros of MapReduce

- Fault tolerance
- High throughput
- Scale easily
- Lot's of research to optimize the scheduler

---

## Cons of MapReduce

- High latency processing
- Iterative algorithms are very slow (like ML algorithms)
- Skew data can be a problem

---
## When MapReduce is a good choice ?

- When you have HDFS
- To batch process file

---
## When MapReduce is a bad choice ?

- If you need interactive session (data exploration)
- You want to process other things than text file but don't want to learn java
- To run ML algorithme
- To process streams

---
## Keep in mind

- MapReduce is a file processing framework !
- Throughput oriented
- Perfect for batch processing
- No GUI, all CLI ([HUE](https://gethue.com/) can provide a nice GUI)
- For statistics, ML, interactive sessions you should use **Spark**
