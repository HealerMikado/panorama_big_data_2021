## Interpreting vs. compiling




## Making of Computer Science survival kit

### Brainstorm of themes

- [ ] Code profiling to prioritize optimization. Do not spend time to reduce the computation time of a function by 0.5 sec if another function take 10min. Try to optimize the slowest part of your code. 

  - [ ] Python profiling : `cProfile`. Give a lot of information, maybe too much. You have to filter to get only the high level function. An easier solution is to use `time.time`. You could use `timeit`, but it's a bad idea. `timeit` is for benchmarking, not profiling.

    ```python
    import time
    import cProfile
    import pstats
    from pstats import SortKey
    #----------------------------------------------------------------------
    def fast():
        """"""
        print("I run fast!")
        
    #----------------------------------------------------------------------
    def slow():
        """"""
        time.sleep(3)
        print("I run slow!")
        
    #----------------------------------------------------------------------
    def medium():
        """"""
        time.sleep(0.5)
        print("I run a little slowly...")
        
    #----------------------------------------------------------------------
    def main():
        """"""
        fast()
        slow()
        medium()
        
    if __name__=="__main__":
        
        cProfile.run('main()', 'restats')
        p = pstats.Stats('restats')
        p.sort_stats(SortKey.TIME).print_stats(10).print_stats('profiling.py')
    ```

    

- [ ] Good programming practices/tips :
  - [ ] Python :
    - [ ] Multithreading/multiprocessing are not so hard if the processes are independents
    - [ ] Use queue to pass data from one thread to another
    - [ ] Do not append to pandas dataframes ! Append to list then generate a DF from it
    - [ ] Open your resources once !
  - [ ] Do I really need all those 150 columns  ?
  - [ ] Filter before any computation
  - [ ] Proceed a very large dataset but I have independent problem ? Parallelization 
  - [ ] On big request to a db is better than 1000 small. Even the smallest request take time. This time cannot be reduce, so small time * 1000 = not so small time.
  - [ ] Do not download data If you do not need them. For example if your data are on a distance server, run the computation on the server THEN download the result. If you download the data on your computer then run the computation :
    - [ ] The downloading slow down the process
    - [ ] Your computer is likely to be less powerful than the distant server.
  - [ ] Low level language (like C/C++) are faster than high level one (python, java, R). But, there are more difficult to learn and usually code optimization is enough. But for easy tasks, knowing a little of bash is a good thing.
  
- [ ] awk (pronounced *hawk*) : super fast line by line processing unix command.


- [ ] Extract a max from gzip fixed length file. Awk is around two time faster than python. If we parallelize python it become faster than awk, but parallelized awk is still two time faster than parallelized  python. It's not really "big data processing" but for large, but not big data large file, there is simple way to speed up the process. Here is only $\mathcal{O}(n)$ process 
|                     | Small sample (30 files, 4.8 Mo) | Bigger sample (41 files, 1.2 Go) | Even bigger sample (48 files, 3Go) |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| awk                 | 0.23 sec                        | 35 sec                           | 101 sec                            |
| awk parallelized    | 0.07 sec                        | 8 sec                            | 18 sec                             |
| python sequential   | 0.45 sec                        | 77 sec                           | 174 sec                            |
| python parallelized | 0.24 sec                        | 17 sec                           | 40 sec                             |

benchmark done with a :

- 12 logical core
- 16 Go Ram 
- Ubuntu 16.04

- [ ] Keep in mind some common bottlenecks :

  - [ ] Read/write from disk. A common HDD 30-150 MB/sec, SSD 500+ MB/sec. So switching to SSD can improve performances. Your disk are a bottleneck only when you use it a lot.
  - [ ] Network. Transfer very large data through a network take time. So just get what you need
  - [ ] CPU. You are doing to much computations, and your CPU are at its max capacity. No easy solution here. Parallelization, approximation, GPU are leads
  - [ ] Memory bottleneck. You do not have enough RAM -> crash. Increase your RAM, or be smart

  You can monitor your system with tools like windows tasks manager.

# Today's conclusion

--
1. MOST DATA IS SMALL BUT COMPUTATION ON IT CAN STILL BE A CHALLENGE

--
2. DISTIBUTING DOES NOT HELP ; DO IT ONLY IF YOU CAN'T AVOID IT

--
3. SAMPLING IS OFTEN A VERY GOOD SOLUTION

--
4. THERE ARE MANY MANY WAYS TO SPEED UP A COMPUTATION

--
5. THERE ARE ENVIRONMENTAL, ECONOMICAL, ETHICAL AND STATISTICAL CHALLENGES WITH THE ACCUMULATION OF SUCH A QUANT

<!-- POSSIBLE IMPROVEMENTS:

[ ] Add Calc aside Excel when evaluating the of capacity of spreadsheets
[ ] Data on energy consumption of data centers
[ ] Add examples of: comparing to algo taking the same processing time, one of which is sampling
[ ] Add transition at the end of lesson 1.2
[ ] Exemples for awk
[ ] Add exemple of code for compiling R or Python

<!-- Find some graphics and figures about the computation power of machines.-->

Note that what characterises the *data* does not necesserily say anything about the computation you perfom **on** the data. Machine-learning tasks (in the learning phase as well as the prediction phase) can be challenging even with modest amount of data, since some algorithms (typically involving matrix inversion) do not scale well at all. **Scaling** computation will be in the focus of this course. (Of course all this is linked: if we want to update a predicion model on a rapidly arriving massive dataset, we need clever fast computation! Think Spotify's weekly recommandations for their millions of users.)
