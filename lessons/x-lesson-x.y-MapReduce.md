## Making of MapReduce

### Brainstorm of themes

- [x] File processing framework. 
- [x] Part of the hadoop ecosystem
- [x] Two phases
  - [x] Map phase : key value -> key value
  - [x] Reduce : key value -> key value output write on HDFS
  - [ ] So two code to write
- [ ] Theoretically not an obligation hdfs block - map reduce block, but it's the optimum
- [x] Data locality
- [ ] Example : word count (classic), archive file (only mapper)
- [ ] Written in java, so more effective in java, but Hadoop Streaming make in compatible with *all language* (like python) (*languages that can read and write on the standard output, the language need to be installed on the cluster to be executed). Suited for text processing
- [ ] Parallelisation of task
- [x] Resilient to failure
  - [ ] If a map task fail (completed or in-progress) : re-execute
  - [ ] If a reduce task fail (in-progress) : re-execute
- [x] Speculative copy
- [x] Pro :
  - [ ] Widely used framework
  - [x] Build on top of HDFS
  - [x] Resilient to failure
  - [ ] The scheduler try to speed up the process with speculative copy



- [ ] Cons :
  - [ ] Interactive processing
  - [ ] Multi step processing
  - [ ] Need HDFS
  - [ ] No stream compatibility (! hadoop stream is for stream file to standard output)
- [ ] You should use MapReduce if
  - [ ] If you already have an HDFS cluster
  - [ ] Batch processing
  - [ ] "One step" processing
  - [ ] Files processed individually 
  - [ ] Text file with 1 line = 1 data
- [ ] You shouldn't use MapReduce if
  - [ ] You want interactive low latency process
  - [ ] If the output is still big and use as an input of a another MR task
  - [ ] If you do machine learning
  - [ ] Is those 3 cases -> Spark
- [ ] Keep in mind :
  - [ ] Only a file processing framework
  - [ ] On top of HDFS
  - [ ] Write in java, so java offer the most tools
  - [ ] But Hadoop Stream made it possible to use other language (like python)
